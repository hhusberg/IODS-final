#Read the data from SPSS-generated csv-file. Exciting, let's see how it works!

# UPDATE: After looking around a bit, and first trying the "foreign" package and read.spss-function, which didn't work, I found the 
#"memisc"" package with the as.data.set-function, which at first glance seems to work perfectly!

# So far so good: got the data into a data frame and it looks pretty solid. Above I checked out some of the variables and converted one 
# from integer to categorical (school number). In order to protect the identities of students' and schools I'd removed the school labels prior to importing the data, so R naturlly thought it was a continuous variable. 

# Before I can start analyzing I still need to wrangle the data a bit. As stated above, this dataset is not the final complete dataset, 
# and I will dismember it even more. First of all, I've now decided to look only at my most central variables of interest so I'll remove 
# many of the ones I'd kept when importing.

# on my imported data before select could actually use the data. Now that I've got my dataset working I still need to mutate around a bit. 
# But first I'll do a listwise deletion just to make it easier to operate on the data. In the final analyses I will probably be imputing
